ADM_HMI.ipynb is meant to compute axial solar magnetic dipole moment (D) by utilizing synoptic charts, in this case, synoptic charts particularly from SDO/HMI.

For this code to work and to calculate D, magnetogram data has to be pre-downloaded explicitly from http://jsoc.stanford.edu

Data source: 

Total sunspot number data -> https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/datafiles

SDO/HMI magnetogram data  -> http://jsoc.stanford.edu
